 Pseudo-machine learning project about number prediction
 
This is a project I did when I first heard about machine learning and wanted to play
with a few ideas.

<b>How it works:</b><br>
It attempts to predict a real life person's next "random" number by guessing the most
commonly said number given the previous number.  The theory is that we as humans are
terrible at giving random numbers that are truly random, and this simple arg-max
matrix approach to prediction has yielded around 20%-25% in my experience of testing
it with others.  For contrast, random chance would be 10% (guessing 1/10 digits 0-9)

The result of the program was that I was interested in exploring Machine Learning more
and that I had successfully created a program that can predict given an input, which for
a high school student feels pretty good!
